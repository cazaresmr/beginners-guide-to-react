This code snippet is a simple example of a React application written in JSX syntax.

The first line of the code, [`const rootElement = document.getElementById("root");`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2Freact%2Fbeginners-guide-to-react%2F04a-jsx-tricks.html%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A13%2C%22character%22%3A12%7D%5D "04a-jsx-tricks.html"), is selecting the HTML element with the id of "root". This is where our React application will be mounted.

Next, two constants [`children`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2Freact%2Fbeginners-guide-to-react%2F04a-jsx-tricks.html%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A14%2C%22character%22%3A12%7D%5D "04a-jsx-tricks.html") and [`className`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2Freact%2Fbeginners-guide-to-react%2F04a-jsx-tricks.html%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A15%2C%22character%22%3A12%7D%5D "04a-jsx-tricks.html") are declared. [`children`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2Freact%2Fbeginners-guide-to-react%2F04a-jsx-tricks.html%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A14%2C%22character%22%3A12%7D%5D "04a-jsx-tricks.html") is a string "Hello World", and [`className`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2Freact%2Fbeginners-guide-to-react%2F04a-jsx-tricks.html%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A15%2C%22character%22%3A12%7D%5D "04a-jsx-tricks.html") is a string "container". These constants are then used to create an object [`props`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2Freact%2Fbeginners-guide-to-react%2F04a-jsx-tricks.html%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A16%2C%22character%22%3A12%7D%5D "04a-jsx-tricks.html"), which is a common pattern in React to pass properties to a component.

The [`element`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2Freact%2Fbeginners-guide-to-react%2F04a-jsx-tricks.html%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A17%2C%22character%22%3A12%7D%5D "04a-jsx-tricks.html") constant is a React element defined using JSX syntax. It represents a `div` with properties spread from the [`props`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2Freact%2Fbeginners-guide-to-react%2F04a-jsx-tricks.html%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A16%2C%22character%22%3A12%7D%5D "04a-jsx-tricks.html") object. The spread operator (`...`) is used to pass all properties of the [`props`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2Freact%2Fbeginners-guide-to-react%2F04a-jsx-tricks.html%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A16%2C%22character%22%3A12%7D%5D "04a-jsx-tricks.html") object as props to the `div` element. This means that the `div` will have a [`className`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2Freact%2Fbeginners-guide-to-react%2F04a-jsx-tricks.html%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A15%2C%22character%22%3A12%7D%5D "04a-jsx-tricks.html") of "container" and its children will be the text "Hello World".

Finally, the `ReactDOM.render()` function is used to render the [`element`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2Freact%2Fbeginners-guide-to-react%2F04a-jsx-tricks.html%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A17%2C%22character%22%3A12%7D%5D "04a-jsx-tricks.html") into the [`rootElement`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2Freact%2Fbeginners-guide-to-react%2F04a-jsx-tricks.html%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A13%2C%22character%22%3A12%7D%5D "04a-jsx-tricks.html"). This function takes two arguments: the React element to be rendered and the DOM element where this React element should be mounted. In this case, it renders the [`element`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2Freact%2Fbeginners-guide-to-react%2F04a-jsx-tricks.html%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A17%2C%22character%22%3A12%7D%5D "04a-jsx-tricks.html") into the [`rootElement`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2Freact%2Fbeginners-guide-to-react%2F04a-jsx-tricks.html%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A13%2C%22character%22%3A12%7D%5D "04a-jsx-tricks.html"), effectively adding a `div` with the text 'Hello World' and a class of 'container' to the `div` with the `id` of 'root'.
