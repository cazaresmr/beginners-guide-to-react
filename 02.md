This HTML document is a simple React application. The `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration helps with the proper rendering and functioning of the web page in a browser. The `html` tag with the `lang` attribute set to "en" specifies that the language of this document is English.

The `head` section contains meta-information about the HTML document. The `meta` tag with the `charset` attribute set to "UTF-8" specifies the character encoding for the HTML document. The `meta` tag with the `name` attribute set to "viewport" and `content` attribute set to "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" makes the web page responsive on different devices. The `title` tag sets the title of the web page.

The `body` of the HTML document contains a `div` element with an `id` of "root". This is the root DOM node where our React application will be mounted.

Two `script` tags are used to include the React and ReactDOM libraries from a CDN. React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and ReactDOM provides DOM-specific methods to be used in a web environment.

The third `script` tag contains the actual React code. The [`rootElement`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2Freact%2Fbeginners-guide-to-react%2F02-react-create-element.html%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A12%2C%22character%22%3A12%7D%5D "02-react-create-element.html") constant is a reference to the DOM node with the `id` of "root". The [`element`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2Freact%2Fbeginners-guide-to-react%2F02-react-create-element.html%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A13%2C%22character%22%3A12%7D%5D "02-react-create-element.html") constant is a React element created using the `React.createElement()` function. This function takes three arguments: the type of the element (in this case, a `div`), an object containing the props for the element (here, a [`className`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2Freact%2Fbeginners-guide-to-react%2F02-react-create-element.html%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A14%2C%22character%22%3A8%7D%5D "02-react-create-element.html") of "container" and [`children`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2Freact%2Fbeginners-guide-to-react%2F02-react-create-element.html%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A15%2C%22character%22%3A8%7D%5D "02-react-create-element.html") of "Hello World"), and the children of the element (not used in this case as the children are defined in the props object).

Finally, the `ReactDOM.render()` function is used to render the [`element`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2Freact%2Fbeginners-guide-to-react%2F02-react-create-element.html%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A13%2C%22character%22%3A12%7D%5D "02-react-create-element.html") into the [`rootElement`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2Freact%2Fbeginners-guide-to-react%2F02-react-create-element.html%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A12%2C%22character%22%3A12%7D%5D "02-react-create-element.html"). This function takes two arguments: the React element to be rendered and the DOM element where this React element should be mounted. In this case, it renders the [`element`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2Freact%2Fbeginners-guide-to-react%2F02-react-create-element.html%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A13%2C%22character%22%3A12%7D%5D "02-react-create-element.html") into the [`rootElement`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2Freact%2Fbeginners-guide-to-react%2F02-react-create-element.html%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A12%2C%22character%22%3A12%7D%5D "02-react-create-element.html"), effectively adding a `div` with the text 'Hello World' and a class of 'container' to the `div` with the `id` of 'root'.
