It takes one prop, `children`, which is a special prop in React that is used to display whatever you include between the opening and closing tags when invoking a component. In this case, the [`Message`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2Freact%2Fbeginners-guide-to-react%2F06-custom-component.html%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A6%2C%22character%22%3A13%7D%5D "06-custom-component.html") component will display whatever is passed as children inside a `div` with the class name "message".

It represents a `div` with the class name "container", which contains two [`Message`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2Freact%2Fbeginners-guide-to-react%2F06-custom-component.html%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A6%2C%22character%22%3A13%7D%5D "06-custom-component.html") components. The first [`Message`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2Freact%2Fbeginners-guide-to-react%2F06-custom-component.html%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A6%2C%22character%22%3A13%7D%5D "06-custom-component.html") component has the text "Hello World" as its children, and the second [`Message`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2Freact%2Fbeginners-guide-to-react%2F06-custom-component.html%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A6%2C%22character%22%3A13%7D%5D "06-custom-component.html") component has the text "Goodbye World" as its children. When these [`Message`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2Freact%2Fbeginners-guide-to-react%2F06-custom-component.html%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A6%2C%22character%22%3A13%7D%5D "06-custom-component.html") components are rendered, they will each create a `div` with the class name "message", containing the respective text.

Finally, the `ReactDOM.render()` function is used to render the [`element`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2Freact%2Fbeginners-guide-to-react%2F06-custom-component.html%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A10%2C%22character%22%3A10%7D%5D "06-custom-component.html") into the HTML element with the id of "root". This function takes two arguments: the React element to be rendered and the DOM element where this React element should be mounted. In this case, it renders the [`element`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2Freact%2Fbeginners-guide-to-react%2F06-custom-component.html%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A10%2C%22character%22%3A10%7D%5D "06-custom-component.html") into the `div` with the `id` of 'root'. As a result, the text "Hello World" and "Goodbye World" will be displayed on the webpage, each wrapped in a `div` with the class name "message", and both of these `div`s are contained within a `div` with the class name "container".
