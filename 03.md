This HTML document is a simple React application that uses JSX syntax. JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that is used with React to describe what the UI should look like. It looks like HTML, but it's actually JavaScript.

The `body` of the HTML document contains a `div` element with an `id` of "root". This is the root DOM node where our React application will be mounted.

Three `script` tags are used to include the React, ReactDOM, and Babel libraries from a CDN. React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, ReactDOM provides DOM-specific methods to be used in a web environment, and Babel is a JavaScript compiler that can translate JSX into regular JavaScript.

The fourth `script` tag contains the actual React code. The `type` attribute is set to "text/babel" to indicate that the code inside this script tag is using JSX syntax and needs to be transpiled by Babel.

The [`rootElement`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2Freact%2Fbeginners-guide-to-react%2F03-jsx.html%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A13%2C%22character%22%3A12%7D%5D "03-jsx.html") constant is a reference to the DOM node with the `id` of "root". The [`element`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2Freact%2Fbeginners-guide-to-react%2F03-jsx.html%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A14%2C%22character%22%3A12%7D%5D "03-jsx.html") constant is a React element defined using JSX syntax. It represents a `div` with a [`className`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2Freact%2Fbeginners-guide-to-react%2F03-jsx.html%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A14%2C%22character%22%3A27%7D%5D "03-jsx.html") of "container" and the text "Hello World 3".

Finally, the `ReactDOM.render()` function is used to render the [`element`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2Freact%2Fbeginners-guide-to-react%2F03-jsx.html%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A14%2C%22character%22%3A12%7D%5D "03-jsx.html") into the [`rootElement`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2Freact%2Fbeginners-guide-to-react%2F03-jsx.html%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A13%2C%22character%22%3A12%7D%5D "03-jsx.html"). This function takes two arguments: the React element to be rendered and the DOM element where this React element should be mounted. In this case, it renders the [`element`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2Freact%2Fbeginners-guide-to-react%2F03-jsx.html%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A14%2C%22character%22%3A12%7D%5D "03-jsx.html") into the [`rootElement`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fcazaresmr%2FDesktop%2FtrueCoders%2Frepos%2Freact%2Fbeginners-guide-to-react%2F03-jsx.html%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A13%2C%22character%22%3A12%7D%5D "03-jsx.html"), effectively adding a `div` with the text 'Hello World 3' and a class of 'container' to the `div` with the `id` of 'root'.
