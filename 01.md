<!--
This HTML document contains a body element with a div element and a script element. The div element has an id of "root", which is used as a reference point in the JavaScript code within the script tag.

The JavaScript code begins by declaring a constant variable rootElement and assigns it the element with the id of "root". This is done using the document.getElementById() method, which returns the first element in the document with the specified id.

Next, a new div element is created using the document.createElement() method and assigned to the constant variable element. The createElement() method creates an HTML element specified by the tagname, in this case, a div.

The textContent property of element is then set to 'Hello World'. The textContent property represents the text content of a node and its descendants. Here, it sets the text inside the newly created div to 'Hello World'.

The className property of element is set to 'container'. The className property gets and sets the value of the class attribute of the specified element.

Finally, the newly created div element (now with text content 'Hello World' and a class of 'container') is appended to rootElement using the appendChild() method. The appendChild() method adds a node to the end of the list of children of a specified parent node. In this case, it adds the element as the last child of rootElement.

So, the end result of this code is that a new div with the text 'Hello World' and a class of 'container' is added as a child to the div with the id of 'root'.
